Hi, I’m Aakrit Singhal

I am currently a high school student, interested in Computer Science and its applications in Machine learning.

My passion for STEM and CS originated from me completing few online courses on Python and Java. Specific interests in machine learning and AI emerged when I read articles on applications such as driver distraction detection and fake news. This made me pursue my interests for NLP and Computer Vision applications. 

Some of my projects include:
- Driver Distraction Detection Model 
- Fake News Detection Model 
- Medical Imaging of X-rays for detection of penumonia and COVID-19
- Disaster Relief Model using NLP techniques of classifying tweets
- Machine Translation models for different languages
